What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was struggling with understanding the relative path and how to find the correct path. I was also stuggling with understanding how the master and branches connected through git and github
What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
	I understand git and github much better now. I also understand how to fix conflicts the occur as well. 
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
	I did not have a pair but my guide helped troubleshoot my gitbash before we began. My my master origin was not working and he helped set up my remote repo again. 
What still confuses you about git?
	I am still a little shaky on relative path. Everytime I feel like I have figured it out but then something else goes wrong and I am confused again. 
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
	I only had my guide but it was great! He was supportive and answered all of my questions. He was really patient with me and was able to explain concepts in ways that I could understand.
